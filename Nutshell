This program could work on multiple Ip Addresses as much as your input. Ensure your ip list, have same login(username and password)
Ensure your api-ssl on your router service is enable, and has default port(or you could edit the script)
Ensure you has librouteros and ssl(in some version included)
This program is not perfect yet, there are need sone improvement. Have a nice code :D
